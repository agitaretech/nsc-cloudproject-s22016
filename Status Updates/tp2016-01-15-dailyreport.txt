1.  What have you completed since the last report?
	
	UI for portrait mode is almost complete.  The android recyclerview has been built for containing each row of 
	image data so it can be scrolled through.  The UI for searching has been put in place, along with an upload
	button for pictures, in the toolbar at the top of the home screen.

2.  What do you plan to complete by the next report?

	By monday, each row of image data will have a handler attached to it for launching the image in a 
	separate activity in an expanded view.

3.  What is getting in your way?

	No major obstacles yet, but Stephen and I need to get together and sync our ideas for the landscape and
	portrait modes of the application.

* What have you completed since the last report?
I have done with upload page. Also I have added "accept" tag to limit uploading to get just mages.


* What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I am planning to 
1- check the project structure and update it
2- Do pull request to update "Master" on toddy's git side
3- research about how to create JSON file in JS to update tags

* What is getting in your way?
Some of our tasks depend on "Dev" team. For example to search, update tables, or 
updating user info (on the top-right of every page), we need to get some 
output from dev team. I think we should redo some of work since dev team is behind.

* What have you completed since the last report?
I finished creating the “Search Box” by using HTML and AngularJS. Also I had meeting with other team members to discuss about reaming work. We work on updating tags yesterday.

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I need to add drag/drop capability to the upload page. Also updating tags need to be done. 

* What is getting in your way?
Since Angular is new to me I should spend more time on several things. Also, 
I do not know why Dev team wants us to set our own server. I think we need to setup a single server and put all works to it.

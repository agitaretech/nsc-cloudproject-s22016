What have you completed since the last report?
I haven’t done a lot from the last daily report.  I’ve downloaded the documentDB package for Python.  I’ve also started to read through the documentation.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I plan to start building the Python widget this weekend.  The widget will connect to our database instance and will be able to perform a simple query to get all documents. 

What is getting in your way?

As of right now, there isn’t anything interfering with my ability to complete milestones or project obligations.

1) I did research on Angular JS using w3Schools & took lesson 2 of codecademy. 
   I also continued to learn how to use GitHub desktop 
   and continued learning to use Source Tree.

2) I am planning to continue the online course at Codecademy to learn Angular JS
   & continue with w3 school tutorials. 

3) I am still having trouble how to access the files from our groups Git
   Also I'm having trouble deleting files from my git branch.

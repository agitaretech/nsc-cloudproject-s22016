What have you completed since the last report?
Iâ€™ve completed the getImages and deleteImages functions for our API and documentDB modules.  I also integrated the code with our Flask App.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to work on the update tags method.  I also plan to complete the API documentation for the client teams.

What is getting in your way?
There is nothing getting in my way of completing my portion of the project.  However, there are several modules that need to be built before I can finish creating our API prototype.

What have you completed since the last report?
I created a documentDB, Azure Storage, and virtual machine on our classâ€™ Azure account to host our API/Back-End App.  This will give both client teams a test environment for their apps.  I also modified the access control for the server response so the Web team can call the API from a remote server.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to work with the Web and Mobile client teams to answer any questions they have regarding the API so they are successful in their implementations.  

What is getting in your way?
There is nothing getting in my way of completing my portion of the project.

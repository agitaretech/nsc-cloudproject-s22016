1.  What have you completed since the last report?
    
    Received feedback from Toddy on the way that the tags are 
    presented to the user.  I have researched and got some ideas 
    from other mobile applications that have tagging features.

2.  What do you plan to complete by the next report?
    
    I will implement a tagging feature more similar to twitter.

3.  What is getting in your way?

    No issues.

* What have you completed since the last report?
Our team had meeting yesterday. We talked about our project, Issues and problems. 
Ksenia works on integrating our display image table with our template.
Also I read about Twitter login and OAuth. Seems lots of thing is happening on Server side. 

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
Our team goal is finishing up the display page. My personal goal is keep learning about Twitter login. 

* What is getting in your way?
As I mentioned before, AngularJS is something new for our team and each team member needs to spend time to accomplish each team goal.

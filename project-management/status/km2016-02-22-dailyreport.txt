* What have you completed since the last report?
Eventually I fixed the HTTP POST issue on my form. Now I am able to send filename and tag names by submitting a form. 

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I am planning to merge this form with upload file. I may change the upload file to send (http post) one image on each HTTP Post to make it simple and functional.

* What is getting in your way?
Since I work on client side (UI), testing actions is hard. I need to take some time to create required PHP file and test my work out.

What have you completed since the last report?

I have successfully created a DocumentDB in Azure. Following a quick tutorial, I was able to create a 
documents noSQL database. In that database I created a collection of images, and added a JSON document
to that collection. The fields in the JSON object are what I believed would be a decent working prototype
storage of our document image metadata. The ID field will be the user's API login ID that is attached to their 
Google/FB/Twitter login, which will control account access of the images. The URL is what the UI team will
use to populate images on the front-end. Tags will still need to be worked out, but for now it is just 
a collection of strings delimited by ","

{
  "id": "234554972168594",
  "url": "https://www.azurecloud.com/app/documents/83nmci8a0",
  "tags": "sunny, grass, forest, sky, birds"
}

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I believe we will plan to get a finalized document DB "non-schema" for the other groups to begin working around.
Based on our implementation, they will need to parse the JSON object for all relavant data.

What is getting in your way?

Nothing is impeding our progress so far. Currently my biggest concern is the layout of our JSON.
I believe we will need to work most on getting all necessary fields together for the JSON object.

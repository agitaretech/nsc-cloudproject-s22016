1. I have implemented a delete option for the edit tags but it is not functional.
2. I have fixed up 3 bugs. They are a loading symbol for the image, maintaining the current list position after tag update, and the photo taking functionality.
3. Our plan is to connect to the Database, fix up some more bugs we have such as the on backpressed for the image popup, resizing and making the bitmap photos
taken much clearer.

* What have you completed since the last report?
Since the last report I read about OAuth and the way we can help Dev team to accomplish twitter login access.  

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I have got an email from Ian and he asked us to set everything based on _POST & _GET. I should check out our work to see if there is anything to do in this case. Also I would like to go for a simple version of uploading image and tagging them. I have no idea for now and need to do some research about it.

* What is getting in your way?
Just having multiple classes in this quarter put lots of pressure on me. I need to do their assignments as well.

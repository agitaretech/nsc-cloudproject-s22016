What have you completed since the last report?
Our team met with Toddy to discuss changes that needed to be made to the API and discussed a timeline on implementing our remaining documentdb functions.  We also changed our API routing calls to accept headers instead of URL parameters to make our API more RESTful.  

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to continue cleaning up the app by putting different files into their own folders to make the application more modular.  I also plan to implement the remaining documentdb functions into the application.

What is getting in your way?
There is nothing getting in my way of completing my portion of the project.  However, there are several modules that need to be built before I can finish creating our API prototype.

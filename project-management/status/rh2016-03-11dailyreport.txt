What have you completed since the last report?
I cleaned up the documentDB file so all the methods are in one location.  I created an instance of the app on our classâ€™ shared Azure account.  I also tested and updated the upload method so the client can upload a file through a http request.  

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to finish the API documentation so the client teams have all of the information to interact with the API.

What is getting in your way?
There is nothing getting in my way of completing my portion of the project.

Status Report 13:

1) I restructured my github folder to include all of my code using 
   Toddy's reccomendations.  I created a Prototype folder and a Web 
   folder with that and inserted all of my prototype code which parses
   a mock up JSON file.  
   I have begun researching how to login in with twitter.
   I have located the js script that needs to be added to our 
   html login page to activate the twitter login. 
   I am researching adding tags to files and searching by tags.  

2) I have just received a new mark up JSON file from
   the back end team and will begin integrating that into my prototype
   code. 
3  Still working on adding tags to files and searching by tags.  
   I am researching how to search by tags and twitter login.

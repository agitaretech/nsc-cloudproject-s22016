What have you completed since the last report?

We've changed our design and this new strategy will involve taking a blob object from the UI teams and uploading directly with that.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I will develop an outline for the UI teams to use so they can send a blob image.

What is getting in your way?

I haven't come up with the proper way of doing it with each language.

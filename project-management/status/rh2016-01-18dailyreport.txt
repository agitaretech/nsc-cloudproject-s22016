What have you completed since the last report?

I started to explore the documentDB documentation to better understand how NoSQL databases work.  I also looked at how to use SQL statements to pull data from a JSON modeled database.  Once I was done researching documentDB, I created a database and collection in my documentDB instance.  Once I created a collection, I was able to add JSON based documents to my database.  I created the JSON document below in my database.  This document serves as a database schema that I will share with my team, during class on Tuesday (1/19). 

{
  "photo_url”: “www.fake_image_url.com”,
  "user_id": "1",
  "tag": [ "fun", "scary", "horror" ],
  "id": "d050f30a-04bb-3630-cfdd-b98a9e26dbc9"
}

This document structure includes all of the information needed to meet our database requirements.  Once I created an example document, I started to play around with queries in Azure’s documentDB portal.  I was a able to create a query that would search for an image’s url for a specific tag name and user id.  The query is below.

SELECT t.photo_url, t.tag
FROM test_data t JOIN tag IN t.tag
WHERE tag = "fun" AND t.user_id = "1"

I also looked at the Python documentation for documentDB but I haven’t created any scripts yet.  I wanted to wait and discuss the schema with my team, prior to creating any code.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I plan to discuss my schema design during our team meeting on Tuesday(1/19).  I’m hoping our team will come to a decision on the technologies we’ll use for our project.  One we decide, I’ll start researching the scripting language we’ll be using and how it interacts with the database we’ve picked. 

What is getting in your way?

As of right now, there isn’t anything interfering with my ability to complete milestones or project obligations.

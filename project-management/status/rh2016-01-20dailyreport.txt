What have you completed since the last report?

As a team we decided on a basic schema based on everyone's input during class.  The basic schema is based on the JSON document below. 

{
  "photo_url": "www.fake_image_url.com",
  "photo_id": "1234",
  "user_id": "1",
  "file_name": "fake_name.jpg",
  "tag": [
    "fun",
    "scary",
    "horror"
  ],
  "id": "d050f30a-04bb-3630-cfdd-b98a9e26dbc9"
}


We also decided to not worry about use cases for downloading images.  Since the image is stored in a URL, the user should be able to right click on the image and download it from the browser.

We met with the client side teams as well and discussed what we could potentially be sending them.  An example is below.

[
  {
    "photo_url": "www.fake_image_url.com",
    "tag": [
      "fun",
      "scary",
      "horror"
    ],
    "file_name": "fake_name.jpg"
  },
  {
    "photo_url": "www.fake_image_url2.com",
    "tag": [
      "fun",
      "exciting",
      "lame"
    ],
    "file_name": "fake_name_2.jpg"
  }
]

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
As for next steps, we split up the research work for the remaining pieces of the project.  The pieces that need to be implemented/researched are below.  Each member will be researching their piece of their project for the next meeting.

I plan to start building a Python widget that can query the documentDB database and add documents to it.  I’ll use the documentDB package for Python listed above.

What is getting in your way?

As of right now, there isn’t anything interfering with my ability to complete milestones or project obligations.

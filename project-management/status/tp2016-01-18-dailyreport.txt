1.  What have you completed since the last report?
    
    I have attached a handler to each image object item that launches a new activity with an expanded version of the photo and all its tags.  Stephen and I merged our code together so now the landscape mode has a unique dual window view.
    
2.  What do you plan to complete by the next report?
    
    Consult with the database team to get an idea of the format our app will receive when making ajax calls.
    
3.  What is getting in your way?

    Nothing is getting in our way, but talking with the other teams is going to be crucial to make more progress.

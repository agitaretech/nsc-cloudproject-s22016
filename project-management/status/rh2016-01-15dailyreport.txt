What have you completed since the last report?
I created a documentDB database instance in my Azure account to learn more about the database.  I also downloaded the Python library that interacts with documentDB and started to look at the included documentation.  

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I’m going to build out a sample schema in documentDB for our meeting on Tuesday.  I’m also going to build a small Python application that connects to the database and executes a simple query.  This will help me better understand how Python interacts with documentDB.

What is getting in your way?
As of right now, there isn’t anything interfering with my ability to complete milestones or project obligations.

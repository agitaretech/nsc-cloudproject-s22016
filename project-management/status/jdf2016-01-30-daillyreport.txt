What have you completed since the last report?

Made a bunch of progress towards generating unique URLs for our blobs

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I will hopefully have a script that can take in a file stream for uploading to the blob, and also have some kind of unique URL generation for each blob

What is getting in your way?

Learning python

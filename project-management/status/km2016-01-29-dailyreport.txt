* What have you completed since the last report?
Project directory and its structure reviewed. Also I pushed (pull request)
The corrected directory (project folder) to Toddy's master Github. 

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
Our next goal for next Tuesday is completing "Display page".
We need to merge two pieces and come up with the final version which meet requirements in wireframe

* What is getting in your way?
Other than this class I have two other classes with lots of class assignments. 
Seems I should copy and paste myself to make enough time to finish all of them. :)

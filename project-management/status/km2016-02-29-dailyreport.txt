* What have you completed since the last report?
As Toddy wanted us to post file and tags all together, I created AngularJS form file which is able to send (POST) file name and three tag names all together. 
You can check it out at: http://www.webolife.com/test/angular/test8

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I am planning to have a meeting with other team members to talk about the above file. Also I am going to merge this file with the original wireframe. Also I may add file drag/drop functionality to the form.

* What is getting in your way?
My problem is checking my work by connecting it to the server. To check my file I used firebug and checked its console to see what is happening. It seems it works perfectly though!

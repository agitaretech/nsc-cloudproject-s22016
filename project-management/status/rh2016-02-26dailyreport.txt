What have you completed since the last report?
I havenâ€™t completed a lot from my last update.  I plan to finish my piece of the project this weekend.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to continue cleaning up the app by putting different files into their own folders to make the application more modular.  I also plan to implement the remaining documentdb functions into the application.

What is getting in your way?
There is nothing getting in my way of completing my portion of the project.  However, there are several modules that need to be built before I can finish creating our API prototype.

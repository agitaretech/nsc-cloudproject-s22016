What have you completed since the last report?
I cleaned up the methods in the main Flask app file and the api_method file.  Both files are almost complete, I’m just waiting on the additional files to call documentdb for deleting metadata, updating tags, and getting images.  I completed the main Flask file’s routing functionality and it now serves JSON pages for each api call.  I also put the standard JSON returns and API keys into their own files.  This allows for modularity when transferring the app to a different servers.  

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to continue cleaning up the app by putting different files into their own folders to make the application more modular.  I also plan to implement the remaining documentdb functions into the application.

What is getting in your way?
There is nothing getting in my way of completing my portion of the project.  However, there are several modules that need to be built before I can finish creating our API prototype.

* What have you completed since the last report?
I read about HTTP PUT to see how it works on the AngularJS platform. Also I had talk with JC (from dev team) to see how we can integrate our code with theirs. I updated other web UI team members and also discussed with them about remaining works. 

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to integrate my code with Avi and Kseniaâ€™s code. They are working on their code now. 

* What is getting in your way?
Leaving all integration works for the last minutes and last week makes me worry. We need some time for debugging or fixing any possible issues.

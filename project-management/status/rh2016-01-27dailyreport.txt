What have you completed since the last report?
Our team decided to use FLASK as a web framework to work with Python.  We choose FLASK because there was more documentation provided by Azure.  I started to research auto incrementing behavior with documentDB and created a Python widget to connect with our test database. 

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
Our team is going to meet on Saturday(1/30).  I plan to finish my widget that connects Python to documentDB by Saturday to share with the team.

What is getting in your way?
There is nothing at this time that is inferring with me contributing to the project.

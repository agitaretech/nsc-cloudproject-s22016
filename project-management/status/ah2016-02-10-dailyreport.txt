Status Report 14:

1) I am in the process of researching how to convert the JSON file
   into a JSON Object and then turn that Object into an array.  
   Also, I attempted cleaning up the Master fork by deleting all my status
   reports and have reorganized my fork according to Toddy's specifiactions. 

2) Researching what I mentioned above, JSON object -> array.
   I have just received a new mark up JSON file from
   the back end team and will begin integrating that into my prototype
   code. 
3  Still working on adding tags to files and searching by tags.  
   I am researching how to search by tags and twitter login.

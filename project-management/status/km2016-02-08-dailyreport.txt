* What have you completed since the last report?
I learned about OAuth. How it works and what we should we have to login with twitter account.
Also Ian and R.J sent two separate emails. Ian gave us his JSON file format yesterday night and R.J sent an email today morning. I forwarded his email to my team members. Also I need to read them carefully tonight.

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
For tomorrow we try to finish display page. Ksenia is the one who is doing that. Avi and I are working on twitter login. We need to finish it this heading week. 

* What is getting in your way?
There are many things new and we need to first learn and read them and then implement them. It takes time.  

* Peer Evaluation

What have you completed since the last report?
I haven’t completed much since the last report.  I met with Ian last night to trouble shoot the GET method code he assembled and I’ve started to write some of the documentation for the API.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to complete the delete function for deleting data from documentDB.  I also plan to migrate the rest of the code from the modules that still need to be completed.

What is getting in your way?
At this point, the API can’t be completed until we have the documentdb modules.  I am still waiting on this code.  Once the documentdb modules are completed, our portion of the project will be complete.  I’m working with my team and trying to create a sense of urgency to get this done this week.

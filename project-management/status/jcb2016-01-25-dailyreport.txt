1. We have merged Brandon Heinrich's camera functions with the application but has minor bugs.
2. We have commented out all of the Facebook and Google Plus functions and just focused on the functioning Twitter login because it is time consuming and we have
not fixed the Facebook and Google plus bugs and also there is another bug for communicating with the fragments.
3. Our plan is to fix up fragment communication and more researching.

1.  What have you completed since the last report?
    
    Integrated Brandon's progess on the camera functionality.

2.  What do you plan to complete by the next report?
    
    Now the app is ready for a little clean up for the UI.  I plan to sylize the buttons that represent each tag for a photo.

3.  What is getting in your way?

    We ended up having trouble transfering data between some of the fragment views in our app.  This did consume quite a bit of time, but we do have it resolved.  Because of this, we didn't get around to applying any polish to the UI like we had hoped.

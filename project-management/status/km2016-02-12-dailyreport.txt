* What have you completed since the last report?
I finished up my reflection and peer evaluation reports. Searched about AngularJS HTTP Post request 
to see how it is possible to send an image and text all together. Also I had short meeting with Avi and Ksenia yesterday talking about the project latest status. 

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I need to search more to find a good AngularJS library to help posting image and text both together. 
Cross your figure for me please!

* What is getting in your way?
The libraries (controllers) I have found to add to our AngularJS have not fully functional and 
sometimes have not worked without giving pointing to any errors. I need to keep working and searching.

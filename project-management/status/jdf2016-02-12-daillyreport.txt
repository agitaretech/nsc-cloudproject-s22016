What have you completed since the last report?

I've added functionality and made modules out of both blobUpload and deleteBlob functions.
Can currently delete blobs, but still looking into the correct parameter that will be
accepted for the blobUpload function. Also looking into the callback functionality

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I will have the callback and blob upload completed

What is getting in your way?

Testing it on a virtual server.

* What have you completed since the last report?
Since last report I had meeting with my team in our class. Also I fixed the HTTP POST bug last night.
Also I emailed my team about remaining works to do. We need to have plan for our next two final week.

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I would like to add drag/drop functionality to the upload page. Then I am going to work on searching tag and displaying them.

* What is getting in your way?
AngularJS is new and there are a few resources online about specific questions like posting image and tags all together. It is not a big problem though!

Status Report 8:

1) I have succesfully parsed a JSON file using my AngularJS controller
   which calls the JSON file with an AJAX call. 
   I am working how to format my parsing using AngularJS ng-repeat 
   so that it will maintain a tabular structure.

2) I am working on how to make a clean table with my parsing.
   I am planning to continue the online course at Codecademy to learn Angular JS
   & continue with w3 school tutorials. 

3) At this point I am able to get each JSON object into a separate table but need
   them all in one table. 
   I am still having trouble how to access the files from our groups Git

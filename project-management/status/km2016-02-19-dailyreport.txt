* What have you completed since the last report?
I had meeting with our group yesterday night. Everybody talked about their accomplishments and concerns. Also, I worked on HTTP Post text based on AngularJS framework. 

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
Ksenia is working on restructuring and merging files. I need to help her to do so. Also I need to spend more time on HTTP Post. 

* What is getting in your way?
I am not able to see the $HTTP Post result since it depends on the server side. I tried some PHP but did not work. 
I need to work on that.

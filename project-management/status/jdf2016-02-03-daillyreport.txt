What have you completed since the last report?

I've researched how we will take a either a blob object or a byte array and put that object directly into blob storage

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

Hopefully I will have a working solution on how to take an image and put it directly on blob storage without having to 
keep it in a local directoy first.

What is getting in your way?

I've never done this before, and documentation on it isn't exactly abundant.

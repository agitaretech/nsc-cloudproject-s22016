What have you completed since the last report?
I worked with the mobile team to get an API test environment up and running for them to use.  I also added a header response to our API so the Web team could access our API through an AJAX call.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I’m going to work on the update tags method and complete the API documentation for the client teams.  I’m also going to set up the Flask app our class’ Azure account.

What is getting in your way?
There is nothing getting in my way of completing my portion of the project.

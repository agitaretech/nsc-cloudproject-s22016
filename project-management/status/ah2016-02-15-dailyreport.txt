1) I am working on turning a JSON OBject into an array.  
   

2) Researching what I mentioned above, JSON object -> array.
   I have just received a new mark up JSON file from
   the back end team and will begin integrating that into my prototype
   code. 
3  Still working on adding tags to files and searching by tags.  
   I am researching how to search by tags and twitter login.

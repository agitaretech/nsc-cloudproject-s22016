* What have you completed since the last report?
I have been looking for a AngularJS library which can give me this opportunity to upload image and text both once together. 

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I am still working on sending text and image both together. I still have lots of issues in this case. On the other hand, I need to spend some time for an alternative simple HTTP POST upload page for dev team. 

* What is getting in your way?
I am not getting any error most of the time I work on JS files. AngularJS lots of time does not give me direct error messages to fix issues.

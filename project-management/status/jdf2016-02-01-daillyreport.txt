What have you completed since the last report?

I wrote a Python script that creates a new container based on the username (still just a placeholder) and generates a
unique URL for every blob based on the timestamp. This is then pushed to blob service, but I can still only use local files.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I plan to figure out how to get a file/stream from the client side so that the user can just upload directly to the blob without
having to store the file locally on the server first.

What is getting in your way?

I've researched it a ton, but I'm unable to find a good solution to doing this. I have to talk to the UI team.

1. We have fixed the camera bug to go back to the Camera Activity from the camera mode.
2. Our app crash when we tried to go back to the Home Activity from the Camera Activity we are believing it is that we are not passing the Twitter credentials
around the activities. The Camera activity navigation is not following our format of navigation.
3. Our plan implement the activities to pass around the Twitter credentials with the possibility of the shared preferences, fix up camera activity navigation and
put more creativity on the interface and of course more researching and prototyping.

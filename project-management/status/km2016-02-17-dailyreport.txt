* What have you completed since the last report?
Yesterday I had meeting with other team members in class. We analyze the latest in progress work. Talked to R.J. and worked on the issue I had on sending tags. It is not fixed yet. Today I am going to take some time and work on that as well. 


* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
By the next week, I plan to figure out why AngularJS does not work when I want to send a text (HTTP POST). Also our team tries to finish display page. Hopefully we can make it as well. Ksenia works on this part.

* What is getting in your way?
AngularJS post tag does not work and does not give me any error. I am struggling with that now.

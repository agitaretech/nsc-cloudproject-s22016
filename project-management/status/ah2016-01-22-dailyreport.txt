Status Report 4:

1) I am continuing to work on how to parse JSON files using an AJAX call via AngularJS.
   I have the backbone of a prototype with a controler.  I made a mock JSON file too.
   I also continued to learn how to use GitHub desktop 
   and continued learning to use Source Tree.

2) I will continue to work on getting JSON file to display in HTML via AngularJS.
   I am planning to continue the online course at Codecademy to learn Angular JS
   & continue with w3 school tutorials. 

3) I have a bug in my code and working on getting the JSON to display.
   I am still having trouble how to access the files from our groups Git
   Also I'm having trouble deleting files from my git branch. 
   I am hoping to colloborate on Tuesday's in class session with groupmates
   to resolve above difficulties.

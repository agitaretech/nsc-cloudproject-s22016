What have you completed since the last report?
I cleaned up the file structure for our API app to make it more modular.  I also updated our API functions to accept headers and eliminated a username parameter that was redundant in our api methods.  These changes make our app more compliant with RESTful standards.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to discuss the changes made to the API with our group on Tuesday and plan to get a status report on the documentDB modules.  I’m also going to work with the client teams to create Azure virtual environments with our API.  This will give them a test environment for interacting with our API.

What is getting in your way?
There is nothing getting in my way of completing my portion of the project.  However, I’m still waiting on the completion of our documentDB modules to complete our API.

1.  What have you completed since the last report?
    
    We ran into a problem where our HomeActivity class was creating multiple versions of
    our Fragment classes.  

2.  What do you plan to complete by the next report?
    
    Since we had to deal with this bug, we didn't make as much progress on our Async class.

3.  What is getting in your way?

    The multiple fragment problem is solved now, so it's no longer in the way.

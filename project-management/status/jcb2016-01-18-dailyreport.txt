1. Today I have completed the login page for Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus.
2. No problems or changes.
3. My plan is to do the code merge with Tobin and Stephens vertical and horizontal home pages and Brandon's Camera pages which might seem difficult
because my login page interacts with its own possible pre-defined activities. Our other full plan is to collabrate with the database team and continue
our research and prototyping.

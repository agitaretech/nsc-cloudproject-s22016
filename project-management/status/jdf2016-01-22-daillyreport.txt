What have you completed since the last report?

I've done a bunch of research on Blob Storage with Azure using Python. I should be able to have a quick script up within a couple days
that demonstrates creating a container and adding a blob to that container in Azure using Python.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I will have a Python script which connects to my Azure account, creates a container, and adds an image to that container in the form of a blob.

What is getting in your way?

The basic process on connecting to Azure with Python. It doesn't look too complicated but it should be pretty doable.

What have you completed since the last report?
I’m continuing to work on the Python widget for tomorrow’s meeting with my team.  I’m also looking at the documentation Toddy sent for Web APIs.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
Our team is going to meet on Saturday(1/30).  I plan to finish my widget that connects Python to documentDB by Saturday to share with the team.  

What is getting in your way?
There is nothing at this time that is inferring with me contributing to the project.

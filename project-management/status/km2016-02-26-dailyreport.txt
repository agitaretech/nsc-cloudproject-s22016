* What have you completed since the last report?
I worked on my basic AngularJS POST form. It is now able to post hidden hard coded input value as well. 

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I am planning to make the above form more dynamic. I do need to hardcode anything. It should be happened automatically and dynamically. 

* What is getting in your way?
I spent over three hours on getting a file path from my desktop PC, combining it with some tags and posting them. Everything works perfect separately but as soon as I merge all of them, It does not work without giving me any error.

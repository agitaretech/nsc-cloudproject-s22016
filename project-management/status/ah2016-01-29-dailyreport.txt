1  I finished formatring my parsing using AngularJS ng-repeat 
   so that it will maintain a tabular structure. In addition, it has a variable
   that shows a number which counts which number each file is. 

2) I am continuing learning angular in order to eventually search by tags.
   I am planning to continue the online course at Codecademy to learn Angular JS
   & continue with w3 school tutorials. 

3) At this point I am able to get each JSON object into a separate table and show
   them all in one table. 
   I am still having trouble how to access the files from our groups Git.
   I am researching how to search by tag.

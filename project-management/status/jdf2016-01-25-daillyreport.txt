What have you completed since the last report?

Successfully created a container and blob storage using Python. Tutorial very easily walks you through the basic process.
Creating a BlobService object allows the script to connect to the Azure account, and from there creating the 
storage URL is very simple. This is the basic concept I believe we will be using for our document image storage.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

Whatever we discuss as a team will be the necessary next step. Based on working BlobStorage, and Tornado,
I believe we will be working to connect all the pieces together to create a JSON object displayed in a webpage
that contains the DocumentDB metadata, and a URL generated through BlobStorage on Azure.

What is getting in your way?

Just need to meet with team members to show all of our work to each other.

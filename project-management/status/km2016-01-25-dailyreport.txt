* What have you completed since the last report?
I have completed file upload since my last report.
Now user is able to select an image OR drag and drop it in 
upload.html file.  

Here is the link you can check it on my personal Hosting space

http://www.webolife.com/test4/upload.html

To see whether it is uploaded or not check this file 
http://www.webolife.com/test4/show.php

or this path 
http://www.webolife.com/test4/uploads/



* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I need to find a way to just choose images to upload. Hopefully everything is done 
till ending this week. 
Also I need to talk to my team members to see what they have completed to 
merge with the rest of files.

* What is getting in your way?
AngularJS is new to me. I have to use lots of js and css libraries which 
I have no idea about them. It takes lots of my time to find them, 
merge them with my default codes, and test them out.

What have you completed since the last report?
I did more research on connecting documentDB to Python.  A lot of the tutorials and documentation pointed towards using FLASK as a web framework with documentDB and Python.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to share my research with my team. I also plan to finish my widget that connects Python to documentDB.

What is getting in your way?
As Iâ€™m doing more research, I have more questions about the stack we chose.  For example, the web framework FLASK works well with Python and documentDB but we choose Tornado.  So, I need to do more research on how we are going to use Tornado with documentDB.  This is not an issue, it just requires more research.

What have you completed since the last report?
I created a Python file that handles our API calls(getImages/GET, deleteImage/DELETE, uploadImage/POST, updateTags/PUT).  This file utilizes the Python methods weâ€™ve created to handle calls to oauth, blob services, and documentDB.  This file will serve as a bridge between our main Flask Python file and the Python files for the services (oauth, blob, documentDB) we utilize. 

I also discussed with our team what is needed to complete our prototype. 

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to clean up the methods in the main Flask file and the API method file.  I also plan to create a JSON handler method so we can return JSON during API calls.

What is getting in your way?
There is nothing getting in my way of completing my portion of the project.  However, there are several modules that need to be built before I can finish creating our API prototype.

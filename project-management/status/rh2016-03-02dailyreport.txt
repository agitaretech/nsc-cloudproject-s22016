What have you completed since the last report?
I met with the client teams to install a test environment on their azure accounts.  As of right now, both teams have a very basic Flask app running on their accounts and have set up a documentdb and storage account.  This will give them the ability to test the API, once it is completed.  I also met with my team to discuss what needs to be completed by next Tuesday. 

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to complete the delete function for deleting data from documentDB.  I also plan to migrate the rest of the code from the modules that still need to be completed.

What is getting in your way?
At this point, the API can’t be completed until we have the documentdb modules.  I am still waiting on this code.  Once the documentdb modules are completed, our portion of the project will be complete.  I’m working with my team and trying to create a sense of urgency to get this done this week.

Status Report 24:

1) After hours of work of researching how to implement Twitter oAuth token and response
   with no progress I contacted Toddy who informed me that much of the work needs to be
   done on the server side.  I turned my attention to styling our forms to be uniform.
 

2) I took about 3 tutorials and poured over a dozen examples.

3  Not at all sure how to integrate twitter oAth login and token into our project.

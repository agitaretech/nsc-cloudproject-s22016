What have you completed since the last report?
I haven’t completed a lot from my last report.  I’ve started to clean up the methods in our main flask file and our API method file.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to continue to clean up the methods in the main Flask file and the API method file.  I also plan to create a JSON handler method so we can return JSON during API calls.

What is getting in your way?
There is nothing getting in my way of completing my portion of the project.  However, there are several modules that need to be built before I can finish creating our API prototype.

What have you completed since the last report?

I've written the code necessary to delete and add images to blob storage. Met with group in person today
and ported our code over to what will eventually be the main VM we test it all on.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I will make some tweaks and changes to my code to add some features

What is getting in your way?

Nothing everything is going smooth.

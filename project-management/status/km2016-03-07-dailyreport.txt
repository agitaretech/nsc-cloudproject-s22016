* What have you completed since the last report?
I am done with my search box. It gets the keywords (comma delimiters) and creates JSON and 
POST it to the server. Created PHP file to get the data and display it. It works 100%.

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I am planning to email my code to my team members. They need to add it to the display page. 
Also we will have class tomorrow. We will have meeting to see what else should be taken care of. 

* What is getting in your way?
Nothing so far.

During this time I was planning to meet with my members of the group project but I did not receive any information where to meet and in what time so I think I emailed and texted to my folks many time but not answer rom anyone.
Today I was continuing in searching for the new task of our project and did not find anything new which will be intersted for the group.
Tomorrow and next day after tomorrow I a m planning to keep searching for better alternative and I hope I can find some schema and make some decision what to do in the next week or so.

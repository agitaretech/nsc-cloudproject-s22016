Yesterday I was talking to the group of people in my group about the project and we have it the good discussion. We decided to switch from Tornado to flask 
Today I was searching for the flask all day and read a lot of about flask and it's implementation
Next day's I am planning to keep searching and on the weekend we are planning to meet together as a group and discuss what next step would be for us.

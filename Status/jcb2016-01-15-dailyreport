Mobile Client group: Joaquin Bautista
1. Today I have completed three tutorials for the Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus login pages but haven't implemented them 
   on our real mobile application.
2. No problems or changes.
3. My plan is still fix up a bug on the Google Plus login page and implement the applied tutorial knowledge of the login pages
   to our app by Monday 1/18/2016.

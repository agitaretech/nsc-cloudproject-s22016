INTRODUCTION:
All clients (web and mobile) will be required to send Twitter OAuth credentials when sending requests to the Application’s Backend API.  These credentials will be required EVERY TIME the front end is requesting/sending information to/from the API.


WHY IS OAUTH IMPORTANT?:
We are using Twitter’s OAuth API for the application’s login.  This allows us to utilize an already existing application for login instead of building out a login system ourselves.  The client (web and mobile) will be using Twitter’s OAuth API for user login.  However, there are still security risks when utilizing Twitter’s OAuth API.  Therefore, the Backend API will verify the Twitter OAuth credentials that are generated by the client (web and mobile).


ABOUT TWITTER’S OAUTH:
I encourage all teams to take a few minutes to review Twitter’s OAuth API.  The documentation from Twitter is great in regards to OAuth.  Twitter’s OAuth: https://dev.twitter.com/oauth


WHAT THE CLIENT WILL NEED TO GENERATE FOR THE OAUTH CREDENTIALS:
*****IMPORTANT******
In order for the application’s OAuth verification to work, the application as a whole must use the same Twitter application.  JC has created a twitter account that will serve as the application’s Twitter developer account.  The Twitter credentials are below.

Username: mobiletestgroup1234@gmail.com
Password: testourapp

JC has already created an application on Twitter’s developer page.  The application’s credentials are needed when utilizing Twitter’s OAuth login.  The credentials are below.

Twitter Key: kbwf3Qbb6MfjXiPirco5j3UYe
Twitter Secret: 1Lr0HOTxQBLU22FsH2CH9RFBtnQCHwjAsidZrctvYoy9yIDX7n


WHAT THE BACKEND API NEEDS WHEN MAKING REQUESTS:
The client (web and mobile) will need to generate a Twitter access token and secret when the user logs into the application.  The token and secret are different from the above key and secret.  To generate the access token and secret, please see the documentation at https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview.

*****IMPORTANT*****
When making any request to the Backend API, the client must send the Twitter access token and secret in the HTTP request.  Please make sure to encode the token and secret when passing them to the Backend API.  An example of the credentials are below.

Access Token: 4800385332-ZbrU1XfignI2lA3MjQu7U8KbIkTdYAdj1ArMVFR
Access Token Secret: BPSs4gwICptsGVZQc9F2EpWcw6ar1gsv4Nlnqvq5PFIdF

These are instructions on how exactly the image file should be sent over to the server so we can upload into blob storage.
This should be sufficient for the Web UI team since it's in JS.

# To upload files to blob storage, the request method must be "POST"
# and enctype must be set to "multipart/form-data".
self.response.out.write("""
	<html><body>
	<form action="{0}" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
 	 Upload File: <input type="file" name="file"><br>
 	 <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit">
	</form>
	</body></html>""".format(upload_url)
)


For Android, you can do it in only 4 lines

var imageXhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
imageXhr.open('GET', 'path/to/image.jpg', true);
imageXhr.responseType = 'blob';

Status Report 7:

1) I have succesfully parsed a JSON file using my AngularJS controller
   which calls the JSON file with an AJAX call. 
   I also continued to learn how to use GitHub desktop 
   and continued learning to use Source Tree.

2) I have to change my mock up JSON file to fit the format the Server side team 
   will implement. 
   I am planning to continue the online course at Codecademy to learn Angular JS
   & continue with w3 school tutorials. 

3)
   I am still having trouble how to access the files from our groups Git
   Also I'm having trouble deleting files from my git branch. 
   I am hoping to colloborate on Tuesday's in class session with groupmates
   to resolve above difficulties.

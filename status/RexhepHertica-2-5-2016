Yesterday I kept searching the flask and oath and I did not make any decidion  what to pick it up for the project.
Today I was more focused on understanding the need for the project and I was meeting the Microsoft manager for cloud computing it was nice to here from him what is going on with new technology and how they are competing with amazon.
Tomorrow I am planning to keep searhing for our project and I hope to call Ian and ask for my role in this project because I missed the last meeting on Saturday because Ian did not reply by ontime.

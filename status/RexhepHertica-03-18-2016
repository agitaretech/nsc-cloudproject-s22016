Yesterday I was in the class and I saw how our group does on project and I saw some of the coding which is going to get finalised pretty soon.
Today I was reading the Paul's email about the sugestions and how far we are in our project to get done.
Tomorrow I will concentrate on gathering informations about the project and I hope the Ian can call me to make documentation about the final project.

Yesterday we have been discussing for our project in the class and we found a lot of issues and lot of questions which came from web group and android group also we looked the codes and modified some codes to make some test cases.
Today I was researching again those proposals and I was trying to understand what is need to do in the future.
Tomorrow I will do the searching and I would read all the codes from our group people and I will try to make summarize all the codes.

Yesterday we meet in the class with classmates and I was hoping to talk more about our project and we did briefly and I think we are getting closser to the end of the project.
Today I did search and have reading some of the notes and codes from our classmates
Tomorrow I will do the searching and will try to resume the codes from our folks and I would like to have a " picture " of the project how it looks and how it works.

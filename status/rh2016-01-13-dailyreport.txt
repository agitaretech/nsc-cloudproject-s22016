What have you completed since the last report?
Our group met to discuss the technologies we are going to use for the API/DB/Storage solution.  We decided to take the week to research the technologies we are going to use for the quarter.  I started to research documentDB and Python’s library to interact with documentDB. 

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to continue researching documentDB and start building a database schema to share with the team on Tuesday(1/19).  I’m also going to download documentDB’s Python library and start exploring it on my Azure account. 

What is getting in your way?
As of right now, there isn’t anything interfering with my ability to complete milestones or project obligations.

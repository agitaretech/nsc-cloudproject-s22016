This weekend I was trying to make sure that I understand the whole project and I was searching a lot and I was reading the notes and the codes from our group.
Today I was hoping to have a meeting with my clasmates somewhere and to discuss about the final project but loks like no one have time and we will discuss tomorrow in thew class.
Tomorrow I hope we can demonstrate some of the codes which have been written so far and will have a test case to show how it works and how it interacts with the web group and android group from our class.

This weekend I was busy with all the stuff from our classmates which have been posted on canvas and in my email so I spent some time on analysing it.
Today I was hopping to meet with Ian and to preview the coding and some issues with the project but he was busy and we left to meet tomorrow before the class.
Tomorrow I will be at campus before the class and I hope I can meet with Ian and other folks from my group to discuss and to get prepared for the presentation.

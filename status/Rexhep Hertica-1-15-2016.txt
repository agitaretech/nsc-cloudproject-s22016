Yesterday I have been searching for the way how to use the github and I tryed to use Source tree for our project but it did not loook right for me so I asked Ian about the problem and he sugested me to use different one from his search and his view so I followed him and finaly got the file ready to be seen online in my github.
Today I am working on finding the solution for the group project and I am reading a lot of interesting things about SQL and Non SQL so until Monday I am just searching and trying to make decision for myself which one would be a good source for group proposition.
Next day's until next group meeting, I will try to make some researches and make some small practicing with what I will found in internet about our group project.

Also I started reading a tutorial on W3School about AngularJS
I was in contact with Ian about the latest changes and group accomplishments

* What do you plan to complete by the next report?
The most important thing I should to is keep learning about AngularJS.


* What is getting in your way?
AngularJS is a little bit vague to me. I need to study more about it.

Since Monday when we meet in the class with folks we have been discussing about some codes and how to make a second piece of project to run
Today I was searching and also was reading the instructions from the classmates in the project and followed their sugestions.
Tomorrow I will continue to search and read more about our project and I  hope that I can make some progress on understanding the basics of the project and I like to give some contribution from myself into this project.

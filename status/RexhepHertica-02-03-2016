Yesterday we meet with the group of people for our project and discussed about finding the way how to implement methods and rules to the new ideas from flask oath and we discussed also with front end and with mobile site group about their needs and we promisse them to send a json and they are much clear on that.
Today I was searching for way how to find a solution fro our group and still did not find it the right one.
Tomorrow I will concentrate on learning some basic code for the Python which we will use it in our project.

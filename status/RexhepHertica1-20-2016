For this week I have been present in the class with the other group members and we have talked about the issues which we have it for this week
Today I was searching the tornado and read lot of articles about using the tornado in our project.
Tomorrow I will keep continuing to search for the tornado and the schema for our group project so until Monday we will have at least some Schema to present in the class.

Yesterday I received an email from Ian where he sugested to use a JSON and the comparisons in the back end will be made via the photo datetime.
Today I also received another email from Robert J Hunter in which he explained the twitter's oauth, JC has made an account to the twitter and we got the credentials to log in.
Tomorrow I am planing to go more over the both emails and see what I can do to make sure that I am on good path of doing our project.

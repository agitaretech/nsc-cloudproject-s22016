For this week I was doing the searching on the internet as I was planning to find the better solution for the Cloud Practicum Project so It was interesting fact I found which I may disscus with the members of our group
Today the most of the time was looking for SQL and NON SQL 
Tomorrow I will discuss with the group members about their solution and probably find the path to the starting point for each of us.

Yesterday I have been present in the class where we were discussing a lot of issues for our group and the issues for the other groups also and was fun working with my classmates in solving problems with the android group and lot of issues bak and fourth give me a better picture of what we are going to get as a result of the project. 
Today I was trying to focus on those questions from yesterday and start to make some practice on the things which I saw and I though it is a good way to learn about our project.
Tomorrow I will be focusing more on implementing the codes from our groups and the interactions with the android group folks from our class.

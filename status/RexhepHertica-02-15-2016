Yesterday I have read the notes from Ian and RJ and I found interesting facts in them.
Today we meet at Ian's House and were discussing about the project and what we need to make for this project and it was going towards the step to get some results which we like to get it.
Tomorrow I will be in a class and will meet the folks of my group again and will maybe find the better solution for this project.

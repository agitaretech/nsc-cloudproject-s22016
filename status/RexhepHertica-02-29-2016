This weekend since Friday I was focused in reading the codes from my folks in a class.
Today I went to Ian's house for the group project and he informed me that he was canceling the meeting because lot of people from my group did not have enough time for this evening.
Tomorrow I will be in the class and before that we will discuss about the project and how far we are in the realising the steps to the final project.

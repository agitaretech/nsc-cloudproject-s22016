This week I have been searching for the cloud project and the way how to find the better solution and what we need to make the project. 
Today I was trying to do the “homework” and followed the instruction written in canvas about how to use Github and Source Tree. 
The next day’s I am planning to continue on finding from the internet the way how to use SQL or NoSql and will make decision for myself what I can present to my group meeting on Tuesday.

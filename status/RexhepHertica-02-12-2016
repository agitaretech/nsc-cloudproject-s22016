Yesterday I was searching for our project as usual and still I don't get the result for final decision for myself.
Today I was continuing to search for the project and read the sugestions from our classmates from our group.
Tomorrow I will do the same as today and on Monday we were planing to meet at the Ian's house to discuss about next step.

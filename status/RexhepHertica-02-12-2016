Yesterday I was searching for our project as usualy and still I don't get the result which I am looking for final decision to make for myself.
Today I was continuing to search for the project and I was reading the sugestions from our classmates from our group.
Tomorrow I will do the same thing as today and on Monday we were planing to meet at the Ian's house to discuss about next step.

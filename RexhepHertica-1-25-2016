This week I was searching and reading lot of new things for Tornado web application and found interesting things about that.
Today I was installing the tornado from sugested web site and I am planning to use for my future work and experimenting with tornado.
Next day I am planning to meet with my members of the group about the schema and cordinating all ideas and searchings from all members of the project group.
